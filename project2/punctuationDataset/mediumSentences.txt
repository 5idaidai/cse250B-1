If you have a need for brokers Scott is a good choice
However if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct deposit
Have you had a chance to gather the title work
Call or email when you get a chance
However I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares
Cost is a major concern but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs

I would consider closing those positions
I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's
Steve and I are inquiring on the email you sent him
When can we reschedule the meeting regarding phantom stock deferral
Unless you close that position you will probably get put those

I looked at the inventory
Phillip Just wanted to give you an idea of what's available
Depending on how much we want to buy we would definitely look at different issues

I don't know if this would be agreeable to you
If we could work together on this basis I will complete the design selections
However we are leaning towards Kerrville
Thank you for meeting with us today
Feedback Approach We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you gave us and move forward with this approach
Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating
Based on the optimistic back loaded returns I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time
